## Synopsis
To provide a webinar training series to OD2A peers for substance use data dashboard development focused on opioids and substance use data, provide consultations and technical assistance where feasible, and build partnerships with peers for future collaboration efforts. The training series will highlight and incorporate polysubstance use and co-occurring disorders. 

The webinars will be focused around the Hawaii Behavioral Health Dashboard (HBHD), and the techniques and processes utilized in its development. The dashboard is a demonstration of the inclusive approach HBHD is taking in dealing with substance use, mental health and homelessness in Hawaii, and is expected to support the BHA in reaching vulnerable populations with (or at risk for) opioid use disorder. 
This webinar series for OD2A peer jurisdictions will share: 

* The general steps needed to develop a data analytics framework which forms the foundation of a data dashboard, focusing on best practices for stakeholder engaged design, usability/user-experience (mobile, data download) and accessibility (data download).
* Lesson learned, limitations and strategies to improve success when developing a data dashboard 
* A practical demonstration of how to develop and utilize a data dashboard utilizing the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). 
* The strategies that the HBHD take in an inclusive and integrated approach to substance use, mental health and crisis issues in Hawaii 
These specific examples of strategies used in Hawaii will help inform interventions that can be used in other jurisdictions. Webinars will be recorded and disseminated to the OD2A peer jurisdictions for wider reach.


## Webinars

### Wireframing for Data Dashboards

This webinar will introduce wireframing for dashboards. Wireframing is often the most challenging yet overlooked phase of a dashboard building project. A wireframe is a visual layout of your dashboard. The wireframe captures what graphs and visual displays will be part of the dashboard and how they will be arranged. These wireframes are not fully functional but a representation of the functionality that the dashboard will eventually contain.

The goals of this webinar will be to: 

1. Introduce the concept of wireframing and why it is important.
2. Highlight the use of and importance of wireframes for communication early on in the dashboard design process
3. Teach the steps of how to create dashboard wireframes 

At the end of the webinar peers will: 
* Be able to describe what wireframes are and how they benefit dashboard design
* Be able to identify the basic steps for implementing wireframes in design
* Be able to describe the benefits of using wireframes for communication with stakeholders

### TEDS for Data Dashboards

An introduction to and a practical demonstration of how to develop a data dashboard using Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS)

The goals of this webinar will be to: 

1. Provide an overview of the SAMHSA TEDS A & D datasets
2. Highlight Limitation and Coverage of the TEDS A & D datasets
3. Introduce ways to access the TEDS A & D Datsets and build a data dashboard

At the end of the webinar peers will: 
* Be able to describe what the TEDS dataset is and who administers it
* Be able to describe what data is available for each state, what data is available for the nation, and for which years this data is available 
* Be able to describe how data is collected and structured, and the limitations of the TEDS dataset 
* Be able to describe how the data from the TEDS dataset can be used on a dash
